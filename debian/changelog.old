    Thanks to André Dahlqvist, Joerg Rieger, Thomas Morin, Ivo Timmermans,

ppp (2.3.11-1.4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU, fixed usage of dpkg --compare-versions. $2 in the install scripts
    is empty if this is the first time ppp is installed. This caused some
    spurious output (not sure if it caused a failure or not, but it is
    definitely broken).

ppp (2.3.11-1.2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload, approved by the maintainer.
  * Remove the suidregister mess caused by file diversions in old packages
    in preinst, closes: #57933.
  * Don't ship {chap,pap}-secrets or `provider' chatscript/peer file as
    conffiles, but as examples. Everybody needs to modify these files to
    use them, so dpkg conffile prompt gets to be annoying. Instead, if these
    files don't already exist in their regular locations, install these
    examples in postinst, and remove them in postrm on purge, closes: #58170.
  * Fixed a couple of typos in docs/comments, and explicitely tightened
    some permissions. Updated the copyrights and licenses (yuck! yuck! yuck!).
  * Default value for number of redial attempts with persist option was
    changed from 0 to 10 upstream by introducing a new `maxfail' option.
    It won't be reverted because it can cause unpredictable results, so
    a note (with rationale) was added: in README.Debian, and in postinst
    through debconf or if debconf doesn't exist, through normal cat/read,
    closes: #51588. (added Suggests: debconf to control file for that)
  * Added the following commented out options with descriptions to the
    options file: maxfail, nopersist, persist, demand, idle, holdoff,
    connect-delay.
  * Partially fixed bug #48478 in plog, by making it tail /var/log/syslog,
    grepping for ' pppd\[', if /var/log/ppp.log is not found. Maybe it
    should print out a warning message about local2, not sure. Added a note
    in plog(1) about the local2.*\t-/var/log/ppp.log in /etc/syslog.conf.
  * If they exist, chown root.adm and chmod 640 ppp.log and ppp-connect-errors
    files in /var/log, with postinst, just in case (the former file will be
    set up that way by sysklogd's daily cron).

  * Cleaned up, updated and/or renamed most of the documentation and
    examples, closes: #47570, #57853 (first part).
  * Added missing .TP near the `nomagic' description in pppd(8),

  * Increased chat REPORT buffer, with patch from the bug report,
    closes: #57467.
  * Added a Replaces: on ppp-pam, so dpkg can ditch it properly
    (Conflicts+Replaces), the second part of second part of #57853. :)
  * Added check whether $1 is remove or purge in postrm, the third part
    of #57853.

    + new upstream version closes: #57062.
    + ppp-pam merge back into ppp, as the base system now includes PAM,
      closes: #48237.
